This study explores the application of text mining and sentiment analysis on a dataset of news articles from The Star Malaysia. The purpose of this study is to uncover key themes and sentiments across various news sections, including Business, Tech, Sport, and AseanPlus, through the extraction and visualization of top words, bigrams, and trigrams. Additionally, it aims to evaluate the performance of three machine learning models in predicting sentiments within the articles. The problem addressed is the imbalance in sentiment distribution, predominantly skewed towards positive sentiments, which affects model performance. The approach involves preprocessing the text data, generating n-grams, and applying sentiment classification models, followed by an analysis of confusion matrices and classification reports. The results reveal that while the models perform well in predicting positive sentiments, they struggle with negative and neutral sentiments due to the class imbalance. This study highlights the potential of text mining in extracting valuable insights from large textual datasets and underscores the importance of addressing class imbalance in sentiment analysis.
