This study explores the application of text mining and senti-ment analysis on a dataset of news articles from The Star Malaysia. The pur-pose of this study is to uncover key themes and sentiments across various news sections, including Business, Tech, Sport, and AseanPlus, through the extraction and visualization of top words, bigrams, and trigrams. Addition-ally, it aims to evaluate the performance of three machine learning models in predicting sentiments within the articles. The problem addressed is the imbal-ance in sentiment distribution, predominantly skewed towards positive senti-ments, which affects model performance. The approach involves prepro-cessing the text data, generating n-grams, and applying sentiment classifica-tion models, followed by an analysis of confusion matrices and classification reports. The results reveal that while the models perform well in predicting positive sentiments, they struggle with negative and neutral sentiments due to the class imbalance. This study highlights the potential of text mining in ex-tracting valuable insights from large textual datasets and underscores the im-portance of addressing class imbalance in sentiment analysis.
